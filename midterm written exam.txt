MIDTERM EXAM
Bautista, Ken Joshua S.
what is the difference of state and props.

state
without state the react application is just a static template and also by the help of state it
makes the application interactive. States are mutable which means it can still be 
change unlike props that it can't be changed, State is an internal and controlled by the component itself
while the props is an external and controlled by whatever renders the component and another info state
changes can be asynchronous and can be modified using the useStates while the props are read-only and cannot be modified
